import { Login, Signup } from './components/auth';
import { EnhancedDashboard } from './components/dashboard';
import { BalanceChart } from './components/charts';
```

### Import from main index:
```javascript
import { Login, EnhancedDashboard, BalanceChart } from './components';
```

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Logical Grouping**: Related components are grouped together
2. **Easy Discovery**: Developers can quickly find components by category
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and update related components
4. **Scalability**: New components can be easily added to appropriate folders
5. **Import Clarity**: Clear import paths make dependencies obvious
6. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different areas without conflicts

## Adding New Components

When adding new components:

1. **Identify the category** - Which folder does it belong in?
2. **Update the folder's index.js** - Export the new component
3. **Update the main index.js** - If it's a new category, add the export
4. **Follow naming conventions** - Use PascalCase for component files
5. **Add to README** - Document the new component in this file

## Migration Notes

This organization was implemented to improve the maintainability of the Monity frontend. All existing imports should continue to work through the main `index.js` file, but consider updating imports to use the more specific folder imports for better clarity.
