```

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### 1. Access Control
- [ ] Log in as a **free user**
- [ ] Try to access `/cashflow` - should redirect to `/subscription`
- [ ] Verify "Cash Flow" menu item is NOT visible in sidebar
- [ ] Log in as a **premium user**
- [ ] Verify "Cash Flow" menu item IS visible in sidebar
- [ ] Access `/cashflow` - should load successfully

#### 2. Calendar Display
- [ ] Calendar shows current month
- [ ] Can navigate to previous/next months
- [ ] Daily balances are displayed correctly
- [ ] Negative balances show in red
- [ ] Positive balances show in green
- [ ] Income/expense amounts display on days with transactions

#### 3. Create Scheduled Transaction
- [ ] Click "Add Scheduled Transaction" button
- [ ] Modal opens with form
- [ ] Can select Income/Expense type
- [ ] Can enter description, amount, category
- [ ] Can select scheduled date
- [ ] **One-Time Transaction:**
  - [ ] Select "Once" recurrence
  - [ ] Save successfully
  - [ ] Transaction appears in list
- [ ] **Recurring Transaction:**
  - [ ] Select recurrence pattern (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
  - [ ] Set interval (e.g., every 2 weeks)
  - [ ] Optionally set end date
  - [ ] Save successfully
  - [ ] Transaction appears in list with recurrence info

#### 4. Manage Scheduled Transactions
- [ ] View all scheduled transactions in list below calendar
- [ ] Click edit button - form opens with transaction data
- [ ] Modify transaction and save
- [ ] Changes reflect in list
- [ ] Click delete button
- [ ] Confirm deletion
- [ ] Transaction removed from list
- [ ] Calendar updates to reflect changes

#### 5. Calendar Calculations
- [ ] Create a scheduled income for tomorrow
- [ ] Verify tomorrow's balance increases
- [ ] Create a scheduled expense for tomorrow
- [ ] Verify tomorrow's balance decreases
- [ ] Check that negative balances show red background
- [ ] Navigate to different months - balances should update

#### 6. Cron Job Testing (Next Day)
- [ ] Create a scheduled transaction for today's date
- [ ] Wait for next day OR manually trigger via:
  ```javascript
  // In backend, you can test manually:
  const { scheduledTransactionService } = require('./services');
  await scheduledTransactionService.executeScheduledTransactions();
  ```
- [ ] Verify actual transaction was created in database
- [ ] For recurring: verify `next_execution_date` updated
- [ ] For one-time: verify `is_active` set to false

#### 7. Edge Cases
- [ ] Try to create transaction without required fields - should show validation
- [ ] Try to access scheduled transaction of another user - should fail
- [ ] Create recurring transaction with end date
- [ ] Verify it stops after end date
- [ ] Test with large amounts (e.g., R$ 1,000,000.00)
- [ ] Test with very small amounts (e.g., R$ 0.01)

#### 8. Internationalization
- [ ] Switch to English - all text translates correctly
- [ ] Switch to Portuguese - all text translates correctly
- [ ] Check form labels, buttons, error messages
- [ ] Check recurrence text in list (e.g., "Every 2 weeks")

#### 9. Performance
- [ ] Calendar loads quickly (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] Creating transaction is responsive
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No memory leaks in browser DevTools

#### 10. Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Test on mobile viewport (< 768px)
- [ ] Calendar is usable on small screens
- [ ] Form modal is scrollable
- [ ] Buttons are tap-friendly
- [ ] Sidebar menu works correctly

## Database Verification Queries

After running the migration, verify with these SQL queries:

```sql
-- Check table exists and structure
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'scheduled_transactions';

-- Check RLS policies exist
SELECT * FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'scheduled_transactions';

-- Check indexes
SELECT indexname, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'scheduled_transactions';

-- Test creating a record (should fail if RLS working)
INSERT INTO scheduled_transactions (
  "userId", description, amount, category, "typeId",
  recurrence_pattern, next_execution_date
) VALUES (
  'test-user-id', 'Test', 100.00, 'Food', 1,
  'once', '2025-10-19'
);
-- Should fail with: "new row violates row-level security policy"
```

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you need to rollback the feature:

### Backend Rollback
1. Revert these files:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- backend/controllers/index.js
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- backend/routes/index.js
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- backend/services/index.js
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- backend/models/index.js
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- backend/server.js
   ```

2. Remove new files:
   ```bash
   rm backend/models/ScheduledTransaction.js
   rm backend/services/scheduledTransactionService.js
   rm backend/controllers/cashFlowController.js
   rm backend/routes/cashFlow.js
   ```

3. Restart server

### Frontend Rollback
1. Revert these files:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- frontend/src/App.jsx
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- frontend/src/utils/locales/en.json
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- frontend/src/utils/locales/pt.json
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- frontend/package.json
   ```

2. Remove new directory:
   ```bash
   rm -rf frontend/src/components/cashFlow
   ```

3. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```

### Database Rollback
```sql
-- Drop the table and all related objects
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS scheduled_transactions CASCADE;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_scheduled_transactions_updated_at CASCADE;
```

## Production Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables to Check
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=3000` (or your production port)
- Supabase credentials for production database
- Encryption keys (should be different from development)

### Cron Job Considerations
- Cron runs at **00:01 UTC** daily
- Ensure server stays running (use PM2, systemd, or similar)
- Monitor cron execution via logs
- Consider adding alerting if cron fails

### Monitoring
Add these to your monitoring:
- Scheduled transaction execution count
- Failed execution count
- API endpoint response times for `/api/v1/cashflow/*`
- Database query performance for scheduled transactions

### Performance Optimization (Future)
- Add Redis caching for calendar data
- Optimize balance calculation for large date ranges
- Add pagination for scheduled transaction list
- Consider batch processing for large number of scheduled transactions
